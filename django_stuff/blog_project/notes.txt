Step 1: Starting with python Django project:
    1. django-admin startproject mysite
    2. cd mysite
    3. python manage.py startapp blog or django-admin startapp blog
    4. adding urls.py file in blog
    5. adding forms.py file in blog since we will be adding some forms
    6. setting.py ... add the app in the installed apps. 
    7. python manage.py migrate 
    8. python manage.py makemigrations blog
    9. python manage.py migrate
    10. python manage.py runserver

Step 2: models.py
    1. Setting up models.py -> importing modules/functions like timezone, urlresolvers, revese
    2. Setting up model classes

Step 3: Form.py
    1. Setting up form.py file, it will bring the models 
    and subfields which will be edited. 
    2. We also set up the widgets which will be edited in 
    css file. 
    3. We will create "static" folder under the application 
    rather that inside site, 
    4. "static" folder will have two folders: css, js
    5. Setup templates folder at the same lavel
    6. Update the "settings.py" file with STATIC_ROOT, 
    TEMPLATE_URL, LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL

Step 4: View.py
    1. import templates in the class based view and have html file of the view
    2. Setup site> urls.py file it will point to application urls.py file
    3. setup app urls.py file
    4. Every class of view should be updated in urls.py; 
       some would be connected with the primary key 
       (url requires specific data e.g. specific post) and 
       some wont.

Step 5: Creating Templates for the views
